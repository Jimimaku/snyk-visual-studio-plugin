A flaw was found in FasterXML Jackson Databind, where it does not have entity expansion secured properly in the `DOMDeserializer` class. The highest threat from this vulnerability is data integrity.\n\n## Details\nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input.\nXML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\n\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\n\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n   <username>John</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.7, 2.10.5.1 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/612f971b78c60202e9cd75a299050c8f2d724a59)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2589)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1887664)\n",

It mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.datasources.PerUserPoolDataSource`.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic.

It mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.datasources.SharedPoolDataSource`.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n- Apache Blog\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.8 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2986)\n",

The package mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp2.datasources.PerUserPoolDataSource`.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.8 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2998)\n- [Medium Article](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Al1ex/CVE-2020-36184)\n",

The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.8 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3003)\n- [Medium Article](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n",

The package mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `com.newrelic.agent.deps.ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource`.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.8 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2996)\n- [Medium Article](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n",

A malicious user could perform a SSRF attack via the `javax.swing` gadget (specifically `javax.swing.JTextPane`).\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n- Apache Blog\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10.7 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/7dbf51bf78d157098074a20bd9da39bd48c18e4a)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2854)\n- [GitHub Release](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/releases/tag/jackson-databind-2.9.10.7)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1916633)\n",

The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.9.2, 2.8.11.4, 2.7.9.6 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Comparison](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/compare/jackson-databind-2.9.9.1...jackson-databind-2.9.9.2)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2387)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2389)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2395)\n- [Snyk Blog](https://snyk.io/blog/jackson-deserialization-vulnerability/)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n[com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) is a library which contains the general-purpose data-binding functionality and tree-model for Jackson Data Processor.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. It mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.provider.XSLTJaxbProvider`.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10, 2.8.11.5, 2.6.7.3 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/d4983c740fec7d5576b207a8c30a63d3ea7443de)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2420)\n",

A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered related to `net.sf.ehcache.hibernate.EhcacheJtaTransactionManagerLookup`.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.9.10 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/191a4cdf87b56d2ddddb77edd895ee756b7f75eb)\n- [GitHub Comparison](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/compare/jackson-databind-2.9.9.3...jackson-databind-2.9.10)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2460)\n",

The package mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `com.caucho.config.types.ResourceRef` (aka `caucho-quercus`).\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability does not affect release `2.10.0` onward.\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit (Master)](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/1645efbd392989cf015f459a91c999e59c921b15)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2660)\n- [On Jackson CVE's Blog](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Al1ex/CVE-2020-10673)\n",

The package mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to gadget `org.aoju.bus.proxy.provider.remoting.RmiProvider` (aka bus-proxy).\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2662)\n",

It mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to gadget  `org.apache.commons.proxy.provider.remoting.RmiProvider` (aka apache/commons-proxy).\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating objects from a  sequence of bytes is called deserialization. _Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)) occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, allowing the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` allows deserialization of JSON input to Java objects. If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.4 or higher.\n## References\n- [GItHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/05d7e0e13f43e12db6a51726df12c8b4d8040676)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2666)\n",

If an application using this dependency has the ability to deserialize a JSON string from an untrusted source, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct deserialization attacks.\n\nExploitation of unsafe deserialization attacks through `jackson-databind` requires the following prerequisites: \n\n### 1. The target application allowing JSON user input which is processed by jackson-databind\n\nAn application using `jackson-databind` is only vulnerable if a user-provided JSON data is deserialized. \n\n### 2. Polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type are enabled\n\nPolymorphic type handling refers to the addition of enough type information so that the deserializer can instantiate the appropriate subtype of a value. Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.5 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/840eae2ca81c597a0010b2126f32dce17d384b70)\n- [Github Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2704)\n",

Use of \"default typing\" is considered dangerous due to the possibility of an untrusted method (gadget) managing to specify a class that is accessible through the class-loader and therefore, exposing a set of methods and/or fields.\n\n### 3. An exploitable gadget class is available for the attacker to leverage \n\nGadget chains are specially crafted method sequences that can be created by an attacker in order to change the flow of code execution. These gadgets are often methods introduced by third-party components which an attacker could utilise in order to attack the target application. Not every gadget out there is supported by `jackson-databind`. The maintainers of `jackson-databind` proactively blacklists possible serialization gadgets in an attempt to ensure that it is not possible for an attacker to chain gadgets during serialization. \n\n### Further reading:\n\n - [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic on Medium](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n - [NCC Group Jackson Deserialization WhitePaper](https://www.nccgroup.com/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/2018/jackson_deserialization.pdf)\n - [Java Security Best Practices](https://snyk.io/blog/10-java-security-best-practices/)\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.5 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2698)\n- [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n",

It mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to `br.com.anteros.dbcp.AnterosDBCPDataSource` (aka Anteros-DBCP).\n\n## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n  \nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n  \n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n\n- Apache Blog\n  \n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to version 2.6.7.4, 2.9.10.6 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2814)\n- [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062)\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Kamimuka/cve-2020-24616-poc)\n",

An `h2c` direct connection did not release the `HTTP/1.1` processor after the upgrade to `HTTP/2`. If a sufficient number of such requests are made, an `OutOfMemoryException` could occur leading to a denial of service.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core` to version 10.0.0-M7, 9.0.37, 8.5.57 or higher.\n## References\n- [Apache Security Advisory](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r61f411cf82488d6ec213063fc15feeeb88e31b0ca9c29652ee4f962e%40%3Cannounce.tomcat.apache.org%3E)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/172977f04a5215128f1e278a688983dcd230f399)\n",

By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\r\n\r\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\r\n\r\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r\n   <username>John</username>\r\n</xml>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\r\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\r\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\r\n</xml>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n\n\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `org.codehaus.jackson:jackson-mapper-asl`. \n\nFor `org.codehaus.jackson:jackson-all` releases supporting `jackson-mapper-asl`. As a workaround, for 1.9.X release, the `javax.xml.XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` setting can be enabled. For 2.x releases, the `\"javax.xml.stream.isSupportingExternalEntities` setting can be set to `FALSE`.\n\n## References\n\n- [CVE-2019-10172 Remediation for Jackson Databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2547)\n\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1715075)\n\n- [StackOverflow CVE-2016-3720 Remediation -  jackson-all](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38017676/small-fix-for-cve-2016-3720-with-older-versions-of-jackson-all-1-9-11-and-in-ja)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n[org.hibernate.validator:hibernate-validator](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hibernate.validator/hibernate-validator) is a Hibernate Validator Engine Relocation Artifact.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The `SafeHtml` validator annotation fails to properly sanitize payloads consisting of potentially malicious code in HTML comments and instructions.\n## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser’s Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they’ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n \nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware. \n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.| \n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user’s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n### How to prevent\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code: \n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches. \n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents. \n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.hibernate.validator:hibernate-validator` to version 6.0.18.Final, 6.1.0.Final or higher.\n## References\n- [Apache Security Advisory](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r87b7e2d22982b4ca9f88f5f4f22a19b394d2662415b233582ed22ebf@%3Cnotifications.accumulo.apache.org%3E)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/commit/124b7dd6d9a4ad24d4d49f74701f05a13e56ceee)\n- [Hibernator Security Release Blog](https://in.relation.to/2019/11/20/hibernate-validator-610-6018-released/)\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-10219)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n[org.yaml:snakeyaml](https://code.google.com/p/snakeyaml/source/browse/) is a YAML 1.1 parser and emitter for Java.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). The Alias feature in SnakeYAML 1.18 allows entity expansion during a load operation, a related issue to CVE-2003-1564.\r\n\r\n*Note* While the Maintainer acknowledges the existence of the issue, they believe it should be solved by sanitizing the `inputStream` to the parser\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.yaml:snakeyaml` to version 1.26 or higher.\n## References\n- [Bitbucket Commit](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml/commits/da11ddbd91c1f8392ea932b37fa48110fa54ed8c)\n- [Bitbucket Issue](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml/issues/377/allow-configuration-for-preventing-billion)\n- [Maintainer Report](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml/wiki/Billion%20laughs%20attack)\n- [Proof Of Concept](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml/commits/04378d05777d21d114a9cdc24976ad49c8919222)\n",

        "description": "## Overview\n\n[org.codehaus.jackson:jackson-mapper-asl](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.codehaus.jackson/jackson-mapper-asl) is a high-performance data binding package built on Jackson JSON processor.\n\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection.\nMultiple classes including  `XmlMapper` was found to be vulnerabiltiy to XXE, which might allow attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors.\n\n## Details\nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input.\r\nXML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\r\n\r\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\r\n\r\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r\n   <username>John</username>\r\n</xml>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\r\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\r\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\r\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\r\n</xml>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n\n\n## Remediation\nThere is no fixed version for `org.codehaus.jackson:jackson-mapper-asl`. \n\nFor `org.codehaus.jackson:jackson-all` releases supporting `jackson-mapper-asl`. As a workaround, for 1.9.X release, the `javax.xml.XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` setting can be enabled. For 2.x releases, the `\"javax.xml.stream.isSupportingExternalEntities` setting can be set to `FALSE`.\n\n## References\n\n- [CVE-2019-10172 Remediation for Jackson Databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2547)\n\n- [RedHat Bugzilla Bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1715075)\n\n- [StackOverflow CVE-2016-3720 Remediation -  jackson-all](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38017676/small-fix-for-cve-2016-3720-with-older-versions-of-jackson-all-1-9-11-and-in-ja)\n",
